Contribution Guide
******************

Our eBook is a living product that we hope continues to grow over time to stay relevant with methodological and technological advancements in the field of uncertainty quantificaiton and MultiSector Dynamics at large.  We extend an invitation to you the reader to contribute to one of our interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials.  If you feel you have a contribution that would be relevant and generalizable to the MSD community, please submit a proposal idea `here <https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/msd_uncertainty_ebook/issues/new?assignees=thurber%2C+crvernon&labels=triage&projects=&template=contribution_proposal.yml&title=Contribution+Proposal>`_.  Your proposal will be reviewing by our team and feedback and/or a decision will be provided shortly.  Any contribution accepted will receive it's own DOI and citation so that you may provide an independent reference to your work as you see fit.

Please consider the following requirements for contribution:

- All elements of your contribution MUST be fully open-source and can be distributed with an `Open Source Initiative approved license <https://opensource.org/licenses/>`_ with an understanding that they may be used in community demonstrations and other activities.  Author citations will be present in the notebook for any contributed work to ensure the author(s) receive full credit for their contribution.
- Any data or code reused in your submission must be correctly cited giving credit to the original authors. 
- The notebook provided must be written in English and able to be a stand-alone product that needs no further explanation past what is written in the notebook to make use of it.
- The provided work is not merely a regurgitation of an existing tutorial or demonstration but represents a novel contribution.
- All contributions and communication thereof must abide by our `code of conduct <https://uc-ebook.org/docs/html/code_of_conduct.html>`_.


If you feel your work meets the criteria above, please submit a proposal issue `here <https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/msd_uncertainty_ebook/issues/new?assignees=thurber%2C+crvernon&labels=triage&projects=&template=contribution_proposal.yml&title=Contribution+Proposal>`_.  If your proposal is approved, please submit your draft notebook for review as an attachment using our submission `template <https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/msd_uncertainty_ebook/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/contribution_checklist.md>`_.  We will then review your submission and provide feedback.  Once your contribution has been deemed ready to deploy, we will generate a DOI for your work, launch it to our MSD-LIVE set of interactive notebooks, and feature the contribution in the index of our eBook.

Please feel free to reach out with any further questions.

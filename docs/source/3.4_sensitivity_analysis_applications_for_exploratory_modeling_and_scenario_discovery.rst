Sensitivity Analysis Applications for Exploratory Modeling and Scenario Discovery
#################################################################################

The language used above reflects a use of sensitivity analysis for model fidelity evaluation and improvement (top right panel in :numref:`Figure_3_1`). However, as previously mentioned, when a model has been established as a sufficiently accurate representation of the system, sensitivity analysis can produce additional inferences (bottom right panel in :numref:`Figure_3_1`). For instance, under the factor mapping use, the analyst can now focus on undesirable system states and discover which factors are most responsible for them: for instance, “population growth of above 25% would be responsible for unacceptably high energy demands”. Factor prioritization and factor fixing can be used to make equivalent inferences, such as “growing populations and increasing temperatures are the leading factors for changing energy demands” (prioritizing of factors) or “changing dietary needs are inconsequential to increasing energy demands for this region” (a factor that can be fixed in subsequent model runs). All these inferences hinge on the assumption that the real system’s stakeholders consider the model states faithful enough representations of system states. As elaborated in the Perspectives on model evaluation section, this view on sensitivity analysis is founded on a relativist perspective on modeling, which tends to place more value on model usefulness rather than strict accuracy of representation in terms of error. As such, sensitivity analysis performed with decision-making relevance in mind will focus on model outputs or metrics that are consequential and decision relevant (e.g., energy demand in the examples above).

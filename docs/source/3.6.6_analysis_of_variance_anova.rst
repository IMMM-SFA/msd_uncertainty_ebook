Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
****************************
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was first introduced by Fisher (1930) and has since become a popular factor analysis method in physical experiments. ANOVA can be used as a sensitivity analysis method in computational experiments (referred to as factorial ANOVA) with a factorial design of experiment. Note that Sobol can also be categorized as an ANOVA sensitivity analysis method, and that is why Sobol is sometimes referred to as a functional ANOVA (Brevault et al., 2013). Factorial ANOVA methods are particularly suited for models and problems that have discrete input spaces, significantly reducing the computational time. More information about these methods can be found in Archer et al. (1997), Brevault et al. (2013), and Owen (2013).

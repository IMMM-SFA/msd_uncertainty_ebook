Introduction
=========

As defined in :numref:`1_introduction`, uncertainty quantification (UQ) refers to the formal focus on the full specification of likelihoods as well as distributional forms necessary to infer the joint  probabilistic response across all modeled factors of interest :cite:`cooke1991experts`. This is in contrast to UC (the primary focus of the main document of this book), which is instead aimed at identifying which modeling choices yield the most consequential changes or outcomes and exploring alternative hypotheses related to the form and function of modeled systems :cite:`moallemi2020exploratory, walker2003defining`.

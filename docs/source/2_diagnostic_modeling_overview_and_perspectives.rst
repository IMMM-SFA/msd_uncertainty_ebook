Diagnostic Modeling Overview and Perspectives
*********************************************

This text prescribes a formal model diagnostic approach to IM3 computational experimentation that is a deliberative and iterative combination of state-of-the-art UC and global sensitivity analysis techniques that progresses from observed history-based fidelity evaluations to forward looking resilience and vulnerability inferences :cite:`gupta_reconciling_2008, hadjimichael_advancing_2020`.

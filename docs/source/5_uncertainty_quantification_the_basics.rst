Uncertainty Quantification: The Basics
**************************************

As described in the previous sections, uncertainty characterization (UC) can be defined as exploratory modeling where alternative hypotheses for the co-evolutionary dynamics of influences, stressors, as well as path-dependent changes in the form and function of systems are explored (Marchau et al., 2019). UC exploratory modeling has a consistent focus on the assumptions, structural model forms, alternative parameterizations, and input data sets that are used to characterize the behavioral space of one or more models. The focus of UC is not to exactly quantify and predict probabilistic likelihoods for all possible quantities, but instead to inform which modeling choices yield the most consequential behavioral changes or outcomes, especially when considering deeply uncertain, scenario-informed projections (Moallemi et al., 2020b; Walker et al., 2013).

In comparison, uncertainty quantification (UQ) refers to the representation of uncertainties using probability distributions. The act of quantification requires specific assumptions about distributional forms and likelihoods, which may be more or less justified depending on prior information about the system or model behavior (Frankignoul and Hasselmann, 1977; Zellner and Tian, 1964). Without this justification, alternative specifications may yield substantially different inferences.

Moment-Independent (Density-Based) Methods
******************************************
These methods typically compare the entire distribution (i.e., not just the variance) of input and output parameters in order to determine the sensitivity of the output to a particular input variable. Several moment-independent sensitivity analysis methods have been proposed in recent years. The delta (:math:`\delta`) moment-independent method calculates the difference between unconditional and conditional cumulative distribution functions of the output. The method was first introduced by :cite:`borgonovo2006measuring,borgonovo2007new` and has become widely used in various disciplines. The :math:`\delta` sensitivity index is defined as follows:

.. math::
  S_i=\delta_i=\frac{1}{2}E_{x_i}|f_y(y)-f_{y|x_i}(y)|dy

where :math:`f_y(y)` is the probability density function of the entire model output :math:`y`, and :math:`f_{y|x_i}(y)` is the conditional density of :math:`y`, given that factor :math:`x_i` assumes a fixed value. The :math:`\delta_i` sensitivity indicator therefore represents the normalized expected shift in the distribution of :math:`y` provoked by :math:`x_i`. Moment-independent methods are advantageous in cases where we are concerned about the entire distribution of events, such as when uncertain factors lead to more extreme events in a system :cite:p:`hadjimichael_advancing_2020`. Further, they can be used with a pre-existing sample of data, without requiring a specific sampling scheme, unlike the previously reviewed methods :cite:p:`plischke2013global`. The :math:`\delta` sensitivity index does not include interactions between factors and it is therefore akin to the first order index produced by the Sobol method. Interactions between factors can still be estimated using this method, by conditioning the calculation on more than one uncertain factor being fixed :cite:p:`borgonovo2007new`.

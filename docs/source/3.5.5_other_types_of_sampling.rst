Other types of sampling
***********************

The sampling techniques mentioned so far are general sampling methods useful for a variety of applications beyond sensitivity analysis. There are however techniques that have been developed for specific sensitivity analysis methods. Examples of these methods include the Morris One-At-a-Time (Morris, 1991), Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST; (Cukier et al., 1973)), Extended FAST (Saltelli et al., 1999), and Extended Sobol methods (Saltelli, 2002). For example, the Morris sampling strategy builds a number of trajectories (usually referred to as repetitions and denoted by r) in the input space each composed of N+1 factor points, where N is the number of uncertain factors. The first point of the trajectory is selected randomly and the subsequent N points are generated by moving one factor at a time by a fixed amount. Each factor is perturbed once along the trajectory, while the starting points of all of the trajectories are randomly and uniformly distributed. Several variations of this strategy also exist in the literature; for more details on each approach and their differences the reader is directed to (Pianosi et al., 2016).

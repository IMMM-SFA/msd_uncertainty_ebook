Derivative-based Methods
************************

Derivative-based methods explore how model outputs are affected by perturbations in a single model input around a particular input value. These methods are local and are performed using OAT sampling. For simplicity of mathematical notations, let us assume that the model *g(X)* only returns one output. Following Borgonovo (2008) and Pianosi et al. (2016), the sensitivity index, *S*\ :sub:`i`\ , of the modelâ€™s *i*-th input factor, *x*\ :sub:`i`\ , can be measured using the partial derivative evaluated at a nominal value, :math:`\underline x`, of the vector of inputs:

.. math::

  S_i (\underline x) = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} |_{\underline x{^c{_i}}}

where *c*\ :sub:`i`\  is the scaling factor.

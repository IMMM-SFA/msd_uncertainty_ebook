What are Common Methods?
########################

There are many  methods to quantify  uncertainty. Each  method has advantages and disadvantages for a particular analysis. Here we focus on parametric uncertainty quantification, as a discussion of structural uncertainty quantification is beyond  the scope of this review. Moreover, we prefer to think about structural uncertainty from the perspective of exploratory modeling and deep uncertainty, rather than from the perspective of quantification and selection or averaging.

Uncertainty quantification methods can be broadly classified as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches, particle-based approaches, and emulation-based approaches, though there are some hybrid methods. Several of the most common approaches for uncertainty quantification are described below. In all cases, the computational and conceptual challenges associated with parametric uncertainty quantification grow rapidly with the number of model parameters. As noted in the prior sections, sensitivity analyses are useful for dimensionality reduction prior to conducting parametric uncertainty quantification. Both factor fixing and factor prioritization can be used to limit the number of parameters which are treated as uncertain.

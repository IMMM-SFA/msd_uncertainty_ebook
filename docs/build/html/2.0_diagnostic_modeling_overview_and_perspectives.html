<p>This text prescribes a formal model diagnostic approach to IM3 computational experimentation that is a deliberative and iterative combination of state-of-the-art UC and global sensitivity analysis techniques that progresses from observed history-based fidelity evaluations to forward looking resilience and vulnerability inferences (Gupta et al., 2008; Hadjimichael et al., 2020).</p>

<h2>Perspectives on diagnostic model evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#perspectives-on-diagnostic-model-evaluation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When we judge or diagnose models the terms “verification and validation” are commonly used. However, their appropriateness in the context of numerical models representing complex coupled human-natural systems is questionable (Beven, 2002; Oreskes et al., 1994). The core issue relates to the fact that these systems are often not fully known or perfectly implemented when modeled. Rather, they are defined within specific system framings and boundary conditions in an evolving learning process with the goal of making continual progress towards attaining higher levels of fidelity. For example, observations used to evaluate the fidelity of parameterized processes are often measured at a finer resolution than is represented in the model and then must be scaled up for the evaluation. In other cases, numerical models may neglect or simplify system processes because the data is not available or the physical mechanisms are not fully known. If sufficient agreement between prediction and observation is not achieved, it is challenging to know whether these types of modeling choices are the cause, or if other issues, such as deficiencies in the input parameters and/or other modeling assumptions are the true cause of errors. Even if there is high agreement between prediction and observation, the model cannot necessarily be considered validated, as it is always possible that the right values were produced for the wrong reasons. For example, low error can stem from a situation where different errors in underlying assumptions or parameters cancel each other out (“compensatory errors”). Furthermore, coupled human-natural system models are often subject to “equifinality”, a situation where multiple parameterized formulations can produce similar outputs or equally acceptable representations of the observed data. There is therefore no uniquely “true” or validated model, and the common practice of selecting “the best” deterministic calibration set is more of an assumption than a finding (Beven, 1993; Beven and Binley, 1992). The situation becomes even more tenuous when observational data is limited in its scope and/or quality to be insufficient to distinguish model representations or their performance differences.
These limitations on model verification undermine any purely positivist treatment of model validity: that a model should correctly and precisely represent reality to be valid. Under this perspective, closely related to empiricism, statistical tests should be used to compare the model’s output with observations and only through empirical verification can a model or theory be deemed credible. A criticism to this viewpoint (besides the aforementioned challenges for model verification) is that it reduces the justification of a model to the single criterion of predictive ability and accuracy (Barlas and Carpenter, 1990). Authors have argued that this ignores the explanatory power held in models and other procedures, which can also advance scientific knowledge (Toulmin, 1977). These views gave rise to relativist perspectives of science, which instead place more value on model utility in terms of fitness for a specific purpose or inquiry, rather than representational accuracy and predictive ability (Kleindorfer et al., 1998). This viewpoint appears to be most prevalent among practitioners seeking decision relevant insights (i.e., inspire new views vs. predict future conditions). The relativist perspective argues for the use of models as heuristics that can enhance our understanding and conceptions of system behaviors or possibilities (Eker et al., 2018). In contrast, natural sciences favor a positivist perspective, emphasizing similarity between simulation and observation even in application contexts where it is clear that projections are being made for conditions that have never been observed and the system of focus will have evolved structurally beyond the model representation being employed (e.g., decadal to centennial evolution of human-natural systems).</p>
<p>These differences in prevalent perspectives are mirrored in how model validation is defined by the two camps: From the relativist perspective, validation is seen as a process of incremental “confidence building” in a model as a mechanism for insight (Barlas, 1996), whereas in natural sciences validation is framed as a way to classify a model as having an acceptable representation of physical reality (Oreskes et al., 1994). Even though the relativist viewpoint does not dismiss the importance of representational accuracy, it does place it within a larger process of establishing confidence through a variety of tools. These tools, not necessarily quantitative, include communicating information between practitioners and modelers, interpreting a multitude of model outputs, and contrasting preferences and viewpoints.</p>
<p>On the technical side of the argument, differing views on the methodology of model validation appear as early as in the 1960’s. (Naylor and Finger, 1967) argue that model validation should not be limited to a single metric or test of performance (e.g., a single error metric), but should rather be extended to multiple tests that reflect different aspects of a model’s structure and behavior. This and similar arguments are made in literature to this day (Beven, 2018; Gupta et al., 2012, 2008; Kumar, 2011; Nearing et al., 2020) and are primarily founded on two premises. First, that even though modelers widely recognize that their models are abstractions of the truth, they still make truth claims based on traditional performance metrics that measure the divergence of their model from observation (Nearing et al., 2020). Second, that the natural systems mimicked by the models contain many processes that exhibit significant heterogeneity at various temporal and spatial scales. This heterogeneity is lost when a single performance measure is used, as a result of the inherent loss of process information occurring when transitioning from a highly dimensional and interactive system to the dimension of a single metric (Beven, 2002). These arguments are further elaborated in section 4.1 Understanding Errors.</p>
<p>Multiple authors have proposed that, instead, the evaluation of several model performance signatures (characteristics) should be considered to identify model structural errors and achieve a sufficient assessment of model performance (Gupta et al., 1998). There is however a point of departure here, especially when models are used to produce inferences that can inform decisions. When agencies and practitioners use models of their systems for public decisions, those models have already met sufficient conditions for credibility (e.g., acceptable representational fidelity), but may face broader tests on their salience and legitimacy in informing negotiated decisions (Cash et al., 2003; Eker et al., 2018; White et al., 2010). This presents a new challenge to model validation, that of selecting decision-relevant performance metrics, reflective of the system’s stakeholders’ viewpoints, so that the most consequential uncertainties are identified and addressed (Saltelli and Funtowicz, 2014). For complex multisector models at the intersection of climatic, hydrologic, agricultural, energy, or other processes, the output space is made up of a multitude of states and variables, with very different levels of salience to the system’s stakeholders and to their goals being achieved. This is further complicated when such systems are also institutionally and dynamically complex. As a result, a broader set of qualitative and quantitative performance metrics is necessary to evaluate models of such complex systems, one that embraces the plurality of value systems, agencies and perspectives present. For IM3, even though the goal is to develop better projections of future vulnerability and resilience in co-evolving human-natural systems and not to provide decision support per se, it is critical for our multisector, multiscale model evaluation processes to represent stakeholders’ adaptive decision processes credibly.</p>
<p>As a final point, when a model is used in a projection mode, its results are also subject to additional uncertainty, as there is no guarantee that the model’s functionality and predictive ability will stay the same as the baseline, where the verification and validation tests were conducted. This challenge requires an additional expansion of the scope of model evaluation: a broader set of uncertain conditions needs to be explored, spanning beyond historical observation and exploring a wide range of unprecedented conditions. This perspective on modeling, termed exploratory (Bankes, 1993), views models as computational experiments that can be used to explore vast ensembles of potential scenarios so as to identify those with consequential effects. Exploratory modeling literature explicitly orients experiments toward stakeholder consequences and decision-relevant inferences and shifts the focus from predicting future conditions to discovering which conditions lead to undesirable or desirable consequences.</p>
<p>This evolution in modeling perspectives can be mirrored by the IM3 family of models in a progression from evaluating models relative to observed history to advanced formalized analyses to make inferences on multisector, multiscale vulnerabilities and resilience. Exploratory modeling approaches can help fashion experiments with large numbers of alternative hypotheses on the co-evolutionary dynamics of influences, stressors, as well as path-dependent changes in the form and function of human-natural systems (Weaver et al., 2013). The aim of this text is to therefore guide the reader through the use of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty methods across these perspectives on diagnostic and exploratory modeling.</p>

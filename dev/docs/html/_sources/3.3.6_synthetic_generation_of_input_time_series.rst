Synthetic generation of input time series
*****************************************

Models often have input time series or processes with strong temporal and/or spatial correlations (e.g., streamflow, energy demand, pricing of commodities, etc.) that, while they might not immediately come to mind as factors to be examined in sensitivity analysis, can be treated as such. Synthetic input time series are used for a variety of reasons, for example, when observations are not available or are limited, or when past observations are not considered sufficiently representative to capture rare or extreme events of interest :cite:p:`herman2016synthetic,milly2008stationarity`. Synthetic generation of input time series provides a valuable tool to consider non-stationarity and incorporate potential stressors, such as climate change impacts into input time series :cite:p:`borgomeo2015numerical`. For example, a century of record will be insufficient to capture very high impact rare extreme events (e.g., persistent multi-year droughts). A large body of statistical literature exists focusing on the topics of synthetic weather :cite:p:`herrera2017review,wilks1999weather` and streamflow :cite:p:`lamontagne2018generating,medda2019comparison` generation that provides a rich suite of approaches for developing history-informed, well-characterized stochastic process models to better estimate rare individual or compound (hot, severe drought) extremes. It is beyond the scope of this text to review these methods, but readers are encouraged to explore the studies cited above as well as the following publications for discussions and comparisons of these methods: :cite:p:`borgomeo2015numerical,herman2016synthetic,kirsch2013evaluating,loucks2017water,steinschneider2015integrated,vogel2017stochastic,vogel1988value`. The use of these methods for the purposes of exploratory modeling, especially in the context of well-characterized versus deep uncertainty, is further discussed in :numref:`consequential_scenarios`.

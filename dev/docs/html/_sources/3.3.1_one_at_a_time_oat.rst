One-At-a-Time (OAT)
*******************

In this approach, only one model factor is changed at a time while all others are kept fixed across each iteration in a sampling sequence. The OAT method assumes that model factors of focus are linearly independent (i.e., there are no interactions) and can analyze how factors individually influence model outputs or metrics of interest. While popular given its ease of implementation, OAT  is ultimately limited in its exploration of a modelâ€™s sensitivities :cite:p:`saltelli2008global`. It is primarily used with local sensitivity techniques with similar criticisms: applying this sampling scheme on a system with nonlinear and interactive processes will miss important information on the effect uncertain factors have on the model. OAT samplings can be repeated multiple times in a more sophisticated manner and across different locations of the parameter space to overcome some of these challenges, which would increase computational costs and negate the main reasons for its selection. Given these limitations OAT methods could be used as preliminary, low-cost analyses of the factors' individual effects, but should ultimately be complemented with more sophisticated methods.

    "In this notebook, we will be covering the basics of fitting a Hidden Markov Model-based synthetic streamflow generator for a single site in the Upper Colorado River Basin. First, we will characterize the observed historical flow in the basin from 1909-2013. Then, we will fit a synthetic streamflow generator to the observed flows in the basin in order to create stationary synthetic flows. Finally, we will create a non-stationary version of the generator to create flows that could be representative of plausible future climate in the region. We ultimately show how to place the synthetically generated flows in the context of physically-informed CMIP5 projections to compare the two methods.  "

    "In the Western United States, and particularly the Colorado River Basin, a recent study used tree-ring reconstructions to suggest that the megadrought that has been occurring in the Southwest over the past 22 years is the regions worst drought since about 800 AD (Williams et al., 2022). The study's lead author, UCLA climatologist Park Williams, suggested that had the sequence of wet-dry years occurred without anthropogenic forcing, the 2000s would have likely still been dry, but not on the same level as the worst of the last millennium’s megadroughts.\n",

    "The recent trend of warming and reduced soil moisture in the SW is becoming extremely problematic from a water systems planning and management perspective for the Colorado River Basin. It has becoming rapidly clear that the river is completely over-allocated and won't be able to sustain flow requirements as dictated by the Colorado Compact. Thus, there has been an increasing focus in understanding how susceptible water systems in this region are to plausible future streamflow scenarios. In this tutorial, we'll discuss how to create these scenarios using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)- based synthetic generator. As discussed in [Section 2.1](https://uc-ebook.org/docs/html/2_diagnostic_modeling_overview_and_perspectives.html#overview-of-model-diagnostics) and [4.2](https://uc-ebook.org/docs/html/4_sensitivity_analysis_diagnostic_and_exploratory_modeling.html#consequential-dynamics-what-is-controlling-model-behaviors-of-interest) of the eBook, future climate conditions in the basin represent a deep uncertainty that can lead to highly consequential results. It is advantageous to create a model such as the HMM-based generator in order to facilitate the creation of many ensembles of streamflow that can ultimately be used to force regional water systems models to understand how characteristics of these ensembles affect regional water shortages, operations, and policies.    \n",

    "It is important to remember that streamflow that we have observed in the region is only one instance of hydrology that can occur since the atmosphere is an inherently stochastic system. Thus, we require a tool that will allow us to see multiple plausible realizations of the same variability that characterizes the historical period. The tool that we use to develop synthetic flows for the region is a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM). If a system follows a Markov process, it switches between a number of \"hidden states\" dictated by a transition matrix. Each state has its own Gaussian probability distribution (defined by a mean and standard deviation) and one can draw from this distribution to create synthetic flows that fit the properties of the historical distribution. HMMs are an attractive choice for this region because they can simulate long persistence, particularly long droughts, which is characteristic of the region. The figure below shows an example of a 2-state Gaussian HMM that we will be fitting for this example.\n",

A subset of the dataset is chosen in order to minimize overfitting and to retain a set of data for validation of the model. When we fit our model, we utilize the Baum-Welch algorithm (a special version of the expectation-maximization algorithm) to find the optimal parameters that maximize the likelihood of seeing the observed flows. Ultimately the algorithm will return a mean and standard deviation associated with each state (mus and sigmas defined below) and a 2x2 transition probability matrix that captures the likelihood of transitioning between states (P). We can also retrieve the annual hidden states across the observed series, also known as the Viterbi sequence of states, which classifies each year in a \"wet\" or \"dry\" state. "

This demonstrates how different the historical record can look just within the range of natural variability. It's also important to remember that when droughts occur can also define the ultimate effect of the drought (i.e. is it a time when there is a large population growth or a time when humans can adapt by conserving or building more infrastructure?). A hydrologic drought need not manifest into an agricultural or operational drought of the same magnitude if stored surface water is available. "

However, it's useful to compare our bottom-up synthetically generated flows in the context of global physically-driven CIMP5 projections to get a better understanding of how the two approaches compare. We first aquire 97 CMIP5 projections from the Colorado River Water Availability Study (CWCB, 2012). In each of these projections, monthly precipitation factor changes and temperature delta changes were computed between mean projected 2035–2065 climate statistics and mean historical climate statistics from 1950–2013. These 97 different combinations of 12 monthly precipitation multipliers and 12 monthly temperature delta shifts were applied to historical precipitation and temperature time series from 1950–2013. The resulting climate time series were run through a Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model of the UCRB, resulting in 97 time series of projected future streamflows at the Colorado‐Utah state line."

    "We see the influence of the dry state mean and dry-dry transition parameters. We're likely to see more decadal droughts when we (1) increase the dry-dry transition probability, which inherently will increase persistence of the dry state, and (2) when we make the dry state log mean drier. Note that the CMIP5 scenarios tend to span the extent of the dry mean sample space, but are less representative of the dry transition probability sample space, which suggests that the types of hydrological droughts represented in the projections tend to only be wetter to slightly drier than our baseline. Both methods of producing these scenarios are valid, though studies have suggested that globally-resolved GCMs may be inappropriate to represent regional extremes. Ultimately, if your goal is to produce a variety of ensembles that are characterized by many different drought characteristics, you will likely find that a generator approach will serve this purpose better."

    "## B6.6 Tips to Create an HMM-Based Generator for your Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to fit an HMM-based generator for a single gauge located in the Upper Colorado River Basin. In order to apply this methodology to your problem, you will need to first ask: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Is this model appropriate for my location of interest? We have applied this style of generator to locations where persistent wet and dry states are characteristic, which tends to be in the Western US. Ultimately the best way to judge if an HMM is useful for your application is to fit the model and explore the resulting distributions. Are there two (or more) distinct states that emerge? If not, then your location may not exhibit the type of persistence that an HMM-based generator is useful for. You can consider exploring other styles of generators such as the Kirsch-Nowak generator (Kirsch et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Do I have the right datasets? We use annual data for our location of interest. In this notebook, the HMM is fit to log annual flows. Ultimately, it can be disaggregated to daily flows (using a daily dataset) to be useful in water resources operational applications. You could also disaggregate to a finer resolution than daily if the historical dataset exists.   \n",
    "\n",
    "If you meet these requirements, feel free to proceed through fitting the model using the code available in the notebook. "

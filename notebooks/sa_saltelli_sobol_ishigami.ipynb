    "# Tutorial: Sensitivity Analysis (SA) using the Saltelli sampling scheme with Sobol SA\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will set up a workflow to investigate how sensitive the output of a function is to its inputs. Why might you want to do this? Imagine that this function represents a complex system, such as the rainfall-runoff process of a watershed model, and that you, the researcher, want to investigate how your choice of input parameter values are affecting the model's characterization of runoff in the watershed. Your parameter values are likely uncertain and can take on any value in a pre-defined range. Using a Sobol SA will allow you to sample different values of your parameters and calculate how sensitive your output of interest is to certain parameters. Below, we demonstrate Sobol SA for a simple function to illustrate the method, but the workflow can be applied to your own problem of interest!  \n",

Since ùë•<sub>3</sub> only explains 1% of the output variance, it does not explain output variability meaningfully. Thus, this indicates that there is contribution to the output variance by ùë•<sub>2</sub> and ùë•<sub>1</sub> independently, whereas ùë•<sub>3</sub> does not contribute to the output variance.

This question is problem and context-dependent, but procedures have been identified to rank order influential inputs and which can be used to identify the least influential factors.

It's easy to understand where we might see interactive effects in the case of the simple Ishigami function.

    "## Tips to Apply Sobol SA to Your Own Problem \n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to apply an SA analysis to a simple mathematical test function. In order to apply a Sobol SA to your own problem, you will follow the same general workflow that we defined above. You will need to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose sampling bounds for your parameters and set up the problem dictionary as in Step 1 above. \n",
    "2. Generate samples using the `saltelli.sample` function. This step is problem-dependent and note that the Sobol method can be computationally intensive depending on the model being analyzed. For example, for a simple rainfall-runoff model such as HYMOD, it has been recommended to run a sample size of at least N = 10,000 (which translates to 60,000 model runs). More complex models will be slower to run and will also require more samples to calculate accurate estimates of Sobol indices. Once you complete this process, pay attention to the confidence bounds on your sensitivity indices to see whether you need to run more samples. \n",
    "3. Run the parameter sets through your model. In the example above, the Ishigami function could be evaluated through SALib since it is a built in function. For your application, you will need to run these parameter sets through the problem externally and save the output. The output file should contain one row of output values for each model run.\n",
    "4. Calculate the Sobol indices. Now, the Y will be a numpy array with your external model output and you will need to include the parameter samples as an additional argument.\n",
    "5. Finally, we interpet the results. If the confidence intervals of your dominant indices are larger than roughly 10% of the value itself, you may want to consider increasing your sample size as computation permits. You should additionally read the references noted in Step 5 above to understand more about identify important factors. "

    "The results of the optimization are presented in a parallel axis plot where each of the five objectives (and one constraint) are represented as an axis. Each solution on the Pareto front is represented as a line where the color of the line indicates the value of the NPV objective. The preference for objective values is in the upward direction. Therefore, the ideal solution would be a line straight across the top of the plot that satisfies every objective. However, no such line exists because there are tradeoffs when sets of objectives are prioritized over the others. When lines cross in between axes, this indicates a tradeoff between objectives (as seen in the first two axes).The solution that is most robust in the NPV objective has the highest value on the first axis and is outlined in dark gold. The solution that is most robust across all objectives is outlined in a brighter yellow. "

    "These figures show the combinations of factors that lead to success or failure in different states of the world when the NPV-maximizing and Robust policies are utilized. Each point is a state of the world, characterized by specific values of the parameters, and ideally, we would like the color of the point to be blue, to represent that there are a low number of days with a predator collapse in that world. The gray curve denotes the highly non-linear nature of the boundary that separates successful and failed states of the world. The figures demonstrate the following key points:  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, as asserted above, the policies interact with the system in different and complex ways. In the presence of human action, the stability condition is not sufficient in determining whether the policy will succeed, even though it clearly shapes the system in a fundamental manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the robust policy manages to avoid collapse in many more of the sampled states of the world, indicated by the number of blue points. This presents a clear tradeoff between profit-maximizing performance and robustness against uncertainty.\n"

Therefore, the ideal solution would be a line straight across the top of the plot that satisfies every objective.

When lines cross in between axes, this indicates a tradeoff between objectives (as seen in the first two axes).The solution that is most robust in the NPV objective has the highest value on the first axis and is outlined in dark gold.

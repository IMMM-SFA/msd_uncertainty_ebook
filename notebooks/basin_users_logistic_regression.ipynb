    "## Background\n",
    "Planners in the the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB, shown in the figure below) are seeking to understand the vulnerability of water users to uncertainties stemming from climate change, population growth and water policy changes. The UCRB spans 25,682 km<sup>2</sup> in western Colorado and is home to approximately 300,000 residents and 1,012 km<sup>2</sup> of irrigated land. Several thousand irrigation ditches divert water from the main river and its tributaties for irrigation (shown as small black dots in the figure). Transmountain diversions of approximately 567,4000,000 m<sup>3</sup> per year are exported for irrigation, industrial and municipal uses in northern and eastern Colorado, serving the major population centers of Denver and Colorado Springs. These diversions are carried through tunnels, shown as large black dots in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important planning consideration is the water rights of each user, defined by seniority across all water uses (irrigation diversions, transboundary diversions, power plants etc.) in the basin. To assess the vulnerability of users with varying degrees of water rights seniority, planners simulate the system across an ensemble of scenarios using the state of Colorado's StateMod platform. The model simulates streamflow, diversions, instream demands, and reservoir operations. \n",
